# Production Capability Plan

This plan is the working feature matrix for moving UsrahMedic from the current Cloudflare-ready foundation into a production clinic management system. It is implementation guidance, not a legal, tax, or medical compliance sign-off.

## Status Legend

- `Foundation only`: architecture, docs, sample data, or deployment shell exists, but the workflow is not production-usable.
- `Partially implemented`: a domain contract, simple UI, table, or API slice exists, but the end-to-end production workflow is incomplete.
- `Not implemented`: no meaningful production workflow exists yet.
- `Provider dependent`: code can be prepared, but go-live needs a selected external provider and credentials.
- `Decision required`: the clinic or owner must make a business, compliance, residency, or vendor decision before implementation can be finished.

## Delivery Sequence

### Phase 1 - Production Foundation

1. Decide database residency and target write model.
2. Implement real auth, MFA, staff accounts, RBAC enforcement, branch assignments, audit hardening, CI/CD, monitoring, backup, and release process.
3. Prepare provider decisions for payment, MyInvois, SMS/email, support desk, object storage, and accounting export.

Exit criteria:

- No API trusts temporary role headers.
- Every staff action has a session, actor, branch scope, and audit trail.
- Database, backup, and deployment decisions are documented and tested.

### Phase 2 - Clinic Operations

1. Build patient registry, intake, guardian/dependent model, appointment scheduling, queue, triage, consultation, visit timeline, and medical record correction workflow.
2. Build doctor roster and shared doctor accounts across branches.
3. Pilot one branch with paper/spreadsheet fallback.

Exit criteria:

- One branch can complete registration to consultation to discharge using the system.
- Patient records cannot be hard-deleted.
- Cross-branch access is blocked unless assignment or break-glass rules allow it.

### Phase 3 - Revenue And Medicine

1. Implement billing, editable invoices, receipts, cash drawer, deposits, refunds, panels, claims, MyInvois, and reconciliation.
2. Implement medicine master, stock upload, opening balance, adjustments, stocktake, dispensing, legal registers, and label printing.

Exit criteria:

- Cash/card/QR/e-wallet settlement reconciles with invoices and deposits.
- Stock ledger reconciles from opening balance through dispensing and adjustments.
- Controlled medicine workflows have legal review before go-live.

### Phase 4 - Support, Onboarding, And Patient Experience

1. Implement standard/priority support workflows, onboarding checklists, knowledge base, clinic setup tools, and support access policy.
2. Expand patient PWA after clinical and billing data are real: booking, queue status, dependents, receipts, results, reminders.

Exit criteria:

- New branch onboarding can be run from checklist to sign-off.
- Support staff can help without uncontrolled PHI access.

### Phase 5 - Reporting And Continuous Improvement

1. Build operational, revenue, billing, panel, inventory, doctor, branch, and owner reports from real ledgers.
2. Add scheduled reports, PHI-safe exports, changelog, feedback intake, feature flags, and staged rollout controls.

Exit criteria:

- Owner dashboards reconcile with operational and finance ledgers.
- Export and scheduled report access is auditable and PHI-minimized.

## Provider-Dependent Work

These cannot be completed purely in code:

- IdP/OIDC and MFA recovery channel.
- Malaysia-hosted database decision if local residency is mandatory.
- Payment gateway for RM10 deposits, final payments, refunds, and reconciliation.
- LHDN MyInvois production integration and tax advisor sign-off.
- Panel/TPA/insurer/takaful integrations and contracts, including AIA, PMCare, MiCare, HealthMetrics, CompuMed, and other payer provider credentials or portal workflows.
- SMS/email provider for reminders and auth recovery.
- Document/PDF rendering and secure object storage.
- Label printer and receipt printer hardware/browser print strategy.
- Support desk, status page, monitoring, backup, and accounting export providers.

## Compliance And Policy Gates

- PDPA: privacy notice, consent, access/correction/export, breach workflow, vendor register, cross-border basis.
- MMC: confidential records, no hard delete, corrections ledger, medical report release workflow.
- CKAPS: branch registration, OYB/person-in-charge, incident/complaint/assessable event evidence.
- Pharmacy/medicine: poison group handling, psychotropic/dangerous drug register decision, label content, storage/disposal/recall SOP.
- LHDN: e-invoice states, cancellation/rejection handling, taxpayer profile, audit and reconciliation.
- Support: support staff PHI access policy and vendor processor register.

## Source Of Truth

The code-backed capability map is in `packages/domain/src/productCapabilities.ts`. Tests in `packages/domain/src/productCapabilities.test.ts` ensure the requested production scope stays represented and does not get silently narrowed.
